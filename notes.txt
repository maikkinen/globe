Summary of the received feedback
This whole thing made little sense to others who haven't seen it yet.
What is it actually offering to the user?

--------
TODO:
#1 outline clearly: what do we actually want to say with this?

-the welcoming text --> rephrasing
-the articles are a wall of words --> distill sth interesting out of it
-the "aha" or the takeaway is missing --> give that to users (such as a summary or so) (see #1)
-why we display the coordinates? didn't make sense --> remove, or substitute to something interesting

-move 'About' to different place
-create 'close'-button that takes you 'back to the map'
-responsivity fails totally. --> Fix. 

--------

Agreeing on tasks:
-checking that the data is in shape, there was sth weird (showing too many articles?) --> look into the nesting in markers.js
-based on what we agree, some refactoring coming
-blog
-some relevant About-text + the component's styling to shape
-sth else?
